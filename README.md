### T170B151 Fundamentals of Digital and Microprocessor Systems Semester Project-

## Features

- Measuring the temperature values of the environment using the BMP180 temperature sensor.
- Temperature values are recorded to an external eeprom together with the time they are measured.
- Instant temperature values and time can be seen using LCD Display.
- Daily and weekly minimum-maximum temperature values can be displayed by using external buttons.
- Depending on the user's request, the data on the EEPROM can be deleted with an external button
